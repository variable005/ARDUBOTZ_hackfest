Our goal is to design and develop a web-based Employee Performance & Feedback Management module for GoFlowwâ€™s Atom HR platform. This module should enable comprehensive performance reviews, continuous feedback loops, and personalized development plans. We've used HTML, CSS, JS and Firebase to make this website.
